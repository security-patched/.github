# Security-Patched

## What we do

Apply security updates to packages that have known/reported issues and making them available to the community.

## What we don't do

We **will** limit ourselves to just security updates/issues and as such we will not be creating features, fixing bugs etc etc. Our preference is that if the package is popular then a new group of maintainers will either take over the original repository or create a fork that will become the defacto replacement and the need for our `security-maintenance` package will no longer be necessary, and we can archive the repository and deprecate the package.
