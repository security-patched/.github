# Security-Patched

## What we do

Apply security updates to packages that have known/reported issues, are abandoned (we think) and, then making them available to the community.

## What we don't do

We **will** limit ourselves to just security updates/issues and as such we will not be creating features, fixing bugs etc etc. Our preference is that if the package is popular then a new group of maintainers will either take over the original repository or create a fork that will become the defacto replacement and the need for our `security-maintenance` package will no longer be necessary, and we can archive the repository and deprecate the package.

## Addressing security updates

We have activated Github's dependabot to notify us of any security related updates to packages we are maintaining, we will look to apply those suggestions within the week.

## Have a suggestion?

If you know of a package that requires a bit of attention, let us know in the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/security-patched/discussions) and we will see what we can do.
